# Animalia Kingdom Classification in JavaScript

This project models the classification of the Animalia kingdom using JavaScript. It represents different classes of animals, including those with and without backbones, warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals.

## Steps Taken

1. **Class Definitions:**
   - Created a base class `Animal` with common properties like `name`, `hasBackbone`, and `isColdBlooded`.
   - Extended the base class to create specific classes for different animal classifications (`Arthropoda`, `Fish`, `Amphibia`, `Reptile`, `Aves`, and `Mammal`).

2. **Instance Creation:**
   - Created instances of each animal class, setting their properties based on the provided classification criteria.

3. **Console Output:**
   - Displayed the properties of each animal instance in the console.

4. **Comments:**
   - Used comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each class, constructor parameters, and characteristics associated with each classification.

## Interesting Facts

- **Warm-Blooded vs. Cold-Blooded:**
  - Animals like birds (Aves) and mammals have warm blood, which allows them to regulate their body temperature internally. In contrast, reptiles and arthropods are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is influenced by the environment.

- **Backbones in Classification:**
  - The presence or absence of backbones is a significant factor in the classification of animals. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals all have backbones, while arthropods (e.g., spiders) do not.
